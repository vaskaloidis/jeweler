The **PivotGrid** ships with a&nbsp;fully integrated field chooser. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;invoked using the **PivotGrid**&rsquo;s built-in context menu. In&nbsp;this demo, the field chooser is&nbsp;always displayed near the **PivotGrid** (the **PivotGridFieldChooser** widget is&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;the **PivotGrid**&rsquo;s data source and added to&nbsp;the page). Note that the filtering menu called for the City and Region in&nbsp;the columns allow searching for the required item.
