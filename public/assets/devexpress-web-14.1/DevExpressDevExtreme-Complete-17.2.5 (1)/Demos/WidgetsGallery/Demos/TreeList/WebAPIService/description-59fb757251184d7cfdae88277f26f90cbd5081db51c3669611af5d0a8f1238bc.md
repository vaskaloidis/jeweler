This example demonstrates the **TreeList** widget communicating with a&nbsp;Web API service. Most of&nbsp;the **TreeList** features are enabled, including the header filter, search panel, lookup columns. All data editing and data processing operations are delegated to&nbsp;the server. To&nbsp;see the server implementation, open the _TreeListDemosController_ tab in&nbsp;the MVC&nbsp;approach.
